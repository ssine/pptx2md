# PPTX2MD

[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/pptx2md)](https://pepy.tech/project/pptx2md)

A tool to convert Powerpoint pptx file into markdown.

**Preserved formats:**

* Titles. Custom table of contents with fuzzy matching is supported.
* Lists with arbitrary depth.
* Text with **bold**, _italic_, color and [hyperlink](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md/blob/master/README.md)
* Pictures. They are extracted into image file and relative path is inserted.
* Tables with merged cells.
* Top-to-bottom then left-to-right block order.

**Supported output:**

* Markdown
* [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)'s wikitext
* [Madoko](https://www.madoko.net/)
* [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

## Installation & Usage

### Installation

You need to have _[Python](https://www.python.org/)_ with version later than __3.10__ and _pip_ installed on your system, then run in the terminal:

```sh
pip install pptx2md
```

### Usage

Once you have installed it, use the command `pptx2md [pptx filename]` to convert _pptx file_ into markdown.

The default output filename is `out.md`, and any pictures extracted (and inserted into .md) will be placed in `/img/` folder. 

__Note:__ older .ppt files are not supported, convert them to the new .pptx version first.

__Upgrade & Remove:__

```sh
pip install --upgrade pptx2md

pip uninstall pptx2md
```

## Custom Titles

By default, this tool parse all the pptx titles into `level 1` markdown titles, in order to get a hierarchical table of contents, provide your predefined title list in a file and provide it with `-t` argument.

This is a sample title file (titles.txt):

```
Heading 1
  Heading 1.1
    Heading 1.1.1
  Heading 1.2
  Heading 1.3
Heading 2
  Heading 2.1
  Heading 2.2
    Heading 2.1.1
    Heading 2.1.2
  Heading 2.3
Heading 3
```

The first line with spaces in the begining is considered a second level heading and the number of spaces is the unit of indents. In this case, `  Heading 1.1` will be outputted as `## Heading 1.1` . As it has two spaces at the begining, 2 is the unit of heading indent, so `    Heading 1.1.1` with 4 spaces will be outputted as `### Heading 1.1.1`. Header texts are matched with fuzzy matching, unmatched pptx titles will be regarded as the deepest header.

Use it with `pptx2md [filename] -t titles.txt`.

## Full Arguments 

* `-t [filename]` provide the title file
* `-o [filename]` path of the output file
* `-i [path]` directory of the extracted pictures
* `--image-width [width]` the maximum width of the pictures, in px. **If set, images are put as html img tag.**
* `--disable-image` disable the image extraction
* `--disable-escaping` do not attempt to escape special characters
* `--disable-notes` do not add presenter notes
* `--disable-wmf` keep wmf formatted image untouched (avoid exceptions under linux)
* `--disable-color` disable color tags in HTML
* `--enable-slides` deliniate slides `\n---\n`, this can help if you want to convert pptx slides to markdown slides
* `--try-multi-column` try to detect multi-column slides (very slow)
* `--min-block-size [size]` the minimum number of characters for a text block to be outputted
* `--wiki` / `--mdk` if you happen to be using tiddlywiki or madoko, this argument outputs the corresponding markup language
* `--qmd` outputs to the qmd markup language used for [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) powered presentations
* `--page [number]` only convert the specified page
* `--keep-similar-titles` keep similar titles and add "(cont.)" to repeated slide titles

Note: install [wand](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.6.12/) for better chance of successfully converting wmf images, if needed.

## API Usage

You can also use pptx2md programmatically in your Python code:

```python
from pptx2md import convert, ConversionConfig
from pathlib import Path

# Basic usage
convert(
    ConversionConfig(
        pptx_path=Path('presentation.pptx'),
        output_path=Path('output.md'),
        image_dir=Path('img'),
        disable_notes=True
    )
)
```

The `ConversionConfig` class accepts the same parameters as the command line arguments:

- `pptx_path`: Path to the input PPTX file (required)
- `output_path`: Path for the output markdown file (required)
- `image_dir`: Directory for extracted images (required)
- `title_path`: Path to custom titles file
- `image_width`: Maximum width for images in px
- `disable_image`: Skip image extraction
- `disable_escaping`: Skip escaping special characters
- `disable_notes`: Skip presenter notes
- `disable_wmf`: Skip WMF image conversion
- `disable_color`: Skip color tags in HTML
- `enable_slides`: Add slide delimiters
- `try_multi_column`: Attempt to detect multi-column slides
- `min_block_size`: Minimum text block size
- `wiki`: Output in TiddlyWiki format
- `mdk`: Output in Madoko format
- `qmd`: Output in Quarto format
- `page`: Convert only specified page number
- `keep_similar_titles`: Keep similar titles with "(cont.)" suffix



## Detailed Parse Rules

### Text and Layout Processing
* Text blocks are identified in two ways:
  * Paragraphs marked as "body" placeholders in the slide
  * Text shapes containing more than the minimum block size (configurable)
* Lists are generated when paragraphs in a block have different indentation levels
* Single-level paragraphs are output as regular text blocks
* Multi-column layouts can be detected with `--try-multi-column` flag
* Grouped shapes are recursively flattened to process their contents
* Shapes are processed in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order

### Title Handling
* When using custom titles:
  * Fuzzy matching is used to match slide titles with the provided title list
  * Matching score must be > 92 for a match to be accepted
  * Unmatched titles default to the deepest header level
* Similar titles (matching score > 92) are omitted by default unless `--keep-similar-titles` is used

### Formatting and Styling
* Text formatting is preserved through markdown syntax:
  * Bold text from PPT is converted to `**bold**`
  * Italic text is converted to `_italic_`
  * Hyperlinks are preserved as `[text](url)`
* Color handling:
  * Theme colors marked as "Accent 1-6" are preserved
  * RGB colors are converted to HTML color codes
  * Dark theme colors are converted to bold text
  * Color tags can be disabled with `--disable-color`

### Special Elements
* Images:
  * Extracted to specified image directory
  * WMF images are converted to PNG when possible
  * Image width can be constrained with `--image-width`
  * HTML img tags are used when width is specified
* Tables:
  * Merged cells are supported
  * Complex formatting within cells is preserved
* Special characters are escaped by default (can be disabled with `--disable-escaping`)
* Presenter notes are included unless disabled with `--disable-notes`
